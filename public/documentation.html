    <p>
        T-Flix is a movie app that includes only films and series as well as documentaries in which trans people have either starred as actors/actresses or directors. <br>
        The objective of this work-in-progress project is to build a server-side component of a “movies” web application. <br>
        T-Flix will provide users with access to information about different movies such as transgender directors/actors/actresses and also the release year of each movie as well as the genre and movie summaries.
